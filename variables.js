// What are variables? Variables are containers for storing data
//If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.
//If you think the value of the variable can change, use let

// Examples
const num1 = 5; // This value can't be changed
let num2 = 7; // This value can be changed

// Write three const and three let variables below

// Examples of variable being assigned and that value being changed
let test1 = 9;
test1 = test1 + 5;
console.log({ test1 }) // test1 now equals 14

let test2 = "Hello";
test2 = test2 + " World";
console.log({ test2 });
